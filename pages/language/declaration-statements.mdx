## Introduction

## \`indicator()\`

Every *indicator*[^1] script must contain one call to the
[indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_indicator)
function, which has the following signature:

``` text
indicator(title, shorttitle, overlay, format, precision, scale, max_bars_back, timeframe, timeframe_gaps, explicit_plot_zorder, max_lines_count, max_labels_count, max_boxes_count)
```

The `indicator` function determines the indicator\'s general properties.
The most important arguments of the indicator function are described
below, a full overview of all [indicator()]\` parameters can
be found in its Reference Manual entry.

Only the `title` parameter is mandatory. It defines the name of the
indicator. This name will be used in the *Indicators* dialog box and is
independent of the name used to save the script in your Personal
Library.

`shorttitle` is the short name of the indicator displayed on the chart,
if it must be different than the value of `title`.

`overlay` is a \"bool\" parameter. If it is true then the study will be
added as an overlay on top of the main chart. If it is false then it
will be added in a separate pane. False is the default setting. Note
that if you change the parameter\'s value in a script that is already on
a chart, you need to use the *Add to Chart* button to apply the change.

`format` defines the type of formatting used for study values appearing
on the price axis, in indicator values or in the Data Window. Possible
values are: `format.inherit`, `format.price` and `format.volume`. The
default is `format.inherit`, which uses the format settings from the
chart, unless `precision =` is also used, in which case it will override
the effect of `format.inherit`. When `format.price` is used, the default
precision will be \"2\", unless one is specified using `precision =`.
When `format.volume` is used, the format is equivalent to
`precision = 0` used in earlier versions of Pine Script™, where \"5183\"
becomes \"5.183K\".

`precision` is the number of digits after the floating point used to
format study values. It must be a non-negative integer and not greater
than 16. If omitted, then formatting from the parent series on the chart
will be used. If the format is `format.inherit` and the `precision`
parameter is used with a value, then the study will not inherit
formatting from the chart\'s settings and the value specified will be
used instead, as if `format = format.price` had been used.

**Footnote**



[^1]: Pine Script™ also has a
    [strategy()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_strategy)
    annotation function which is used to create a
    [strategy](/pine-script-docs/concepts/strategies) rather
    than an indicator.
