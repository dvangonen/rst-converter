# Structure of the script

A script in Pine usually consists of:

-   `//@version=4` A compiler directive in a comment that specifies
    which version of Pine the script will use. If the `@version`
    directive is missing, version 1 will be used. It is strongly
    recommended to always use the latest version available.

-   A
    [study](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_study)
    or a
    [strategy](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_strategy)
    annotation call. Their parameters define the script\'s title and
    other properties.

-   A series of statements which implement the script\'s algorithm. Each
    statement is usually placed on a separate line. It is possible to
    place more than one statement on a line by using the comma (`,`) as
    a separator. Lines containing statements that are not part of local
    blocks cannot begin with white space. Their first character must
    also be the line\'s first character. Statements may be one of three
    kinds:

    > -   `variable declarations <variable_declaration>`{.interpreted-text
    >     role="ref"}
    > -   `function declarations <Declaring_functions>`{.interpreted-text
    >     role="doc"}
    > -   `functions and annotations calls <Functions_and_annotations>`{.interpreted-text
    >     role="doc"}

-   A *study* must contain at least one function/annotation call which
    produces some output on the chart (e.g., `plot`, `plotshape`,
    `barcolor`, `line.new`, etc.). A strategy must contain at least one
    `strategy.*` call, e.g., `strategy.entry`.

    The simplest valid Pine v4 study can be generated using *Pine
    Editor* *New* *Blank indicator script*:

        //@version=4
        study("My Script")
        plot(close)

    A simple valid Pine v4 strategy can be generated using *Pine Editor*
    *New* *Blank strategy script*:

        //@version=4
        strategy("My Strategy", overlay=true)

        longCondition = crossover(sma(close, 14), sma(close, 28))
        if (longCondition)
            strategy.entry("My Long Entry Id", strategy.long)

        shortCondition = crossunder(sma(close, 14), sma(close, 28))
        if (shortCondition)
            strategy.entry("My Short Entry Id", strategy.short)
