# Release notes



This page contains release notes of notable changes in Pine Script.

## July 2021

`tostring` now accepts \"bool\" and \"string\" types.

New argument for `time` and `time_close` functions was added:

-   `timezone` - timezone of the `session` argument, can only be used
    when a session is specified. Can be written out in GMT notation
    (e.g. \"GMT-5\") or as an [IANA time zone database
    name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
    (e.g. \"America/New_York\").

It is now possible to place a drawing object in the future with
`xloc = xloc.bar_index`.

New argument for `study` and `strategy` functions was added:

-   `explicit_plot_zorder` - specifies the order in which the
    indicator\'s plots, fills, and hlines are rendered. If true, the
    plots will be drawn based on the order in which they appear in the
    indicator\'s code, each newer plot being drawn above the previous
    ones.

## June 2021

New variable was added:

-   `barstate.islastconfirmedhistory` - returns `true` if script is
    executing on the dataset\'s last bar when market is closed, or
    script is executing on the bar immediately preceding the real-time
    bar, if market is open. Returns `false` otherwise.

New function was added:

-   `round_to_mintick(x)` - returns the value rounded to the symbol\'s
    mintick, i.e. the nearest value that can be divided by
    `syminfo.mintick`, without the remainder, with ties rounding up.

Expanded `tostring()` functionality. The function now accepts three new
formatting arguments:

-   `format.mintick` to format to tick precision.
-   `format.volume` to abbreviate large values.
-   `format.percent` to format percentages.

## May 2021

Improved backtesting functionality by adding the Leverage mechanism.

Added support for table drawings and functions for working with them.
Tables are unique objects that are not anchored to specific bars; they
float in a script's space, independently of the chart bars being viewed
or the zoom factor used. For more information, see our [User Manual page
on
tables](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v4/essential/Tables.html).

New functions were added:

-   `color.rgb(red, green, blue, transp)` - creates a new color with
    transparency using the RGB color model.
-   `color.from_gradient(value, bottom_value, top_value, bottom_color, top_color)` -
    returns color calculated from the linear gradient between
    bottom_color to top_color.
-   `color.r(color)`, `color.g(color)`, `color.b(color)`,
    `color.t(color)` - retrieves the value of one of the color
    components.
-   `array.from` - takes a variable number of arguments with one of the
    types: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, `label`, `line`, `color`,
    `box`, `table` and returns an array of the corresponding type.

A new `box` drawing has been added to Pine, making it possible to draw
rectangles on charts using the Pine syntax. For more details see the
[Pine Script
reference](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_box%7Bdot%7Dnew)
and the [User Manual page on
drawings](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v4/essential/Drawings.html)
.

The `color.new` function can now accept series and input arguments, in
which case, the colors will be calculated at runtime. For more
information about this, see our [User Manual page on
colors](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v4/essential/Colors.html).

## April 2021

New math constants were added:

-   `math.pi` - is a named constant for Archimedes\' constant. It is
    equal to 3.1415926535897932.
-   `math.phi` - is a named constant for the golden ratio. It is equal
    to 1.6180339887498948.
-   `math.rphi` - is a named constant for the golden ratio conjugate. It
    is equal to 0.6180339887498948.
-   `math.e` - is a named constant for Euler\'s number. It is equal to
    2.7182818284590452.

New math functions were added:

-   `round(x, precision)` - returns the value of `x` rounded to the
    nearest integer, with ties rounding up. If the precision parameter
    is used, returns a float value rounded to that number of decimal
    places.
-   `median(source, length)` - returns the median of the series.
-   `mode(source, length)` - returns the mode of the series. If there
    are several values with the same frequency, it returns the smallest
    value.
-   `range(source, length)` - returns the difference between the `min`
    and `max` values in a series.
-   `todegrees(radians)` - returns an approximately equivalent angle in
    degrees from an angle measured in radians.
-   `toradians(degrees)` - returns an approximately equivalent angle in
    radians from an angle measured in degrees.
-   `random(min, max, seed)` - returns a pseudo-random value. The
    function will generate a different sequence of values for each
    script execution. Using the same value for the optional seed
    argument will produce a repeatable sequence.

New functions were added:

-   `session.ismarket` - returns `true` if the current bar is a part of
    the regular trading hours (i.e. market hours), `false` otherwise.
-   `session.ispremarket` - returns `true` if the current bar is a part
    of the pre-market, `false` otherwise.
-   `session.ispostmarket` - returns `true` if the current bar is a part
    of the post-market, `false` otherwise.
-   `str.format` - converts the values to strings based on the specified
    formats. Accepts certain `number` modifiers: `integer`, `currency`,
    `percent`.

## March 2021

New assignment operators were added:

-   `+=` - addition assignment
-   `-=` - subtraction assignment
-   `*=` - multiplication assignment
-   `/=` - division assignment
-   `%=` - modulus assignment

New parameters for inputs customization were added:

-   `inline` - combines all the input calls with the same inline value
    in one line.
-   `group` - creates a header above all inputs that use the same group
    string value. The string is also used as the header text.
-   `tooltip` - adds a tooltip icon to the `Inputs` menu. The tooltip
    string is shown when hovering over the tooltip icon.

New argument for `fill` function was added:

-   `fillgaps` - controls whether fills continue on gaps when one of the
    `plot` calls returns an `na` value.

A new keyword was added:

-   `varip` - is similar to the `var` keyword, but variables declared
    with `varip` retain their values between the updates of a real-time
    bar.

New functions were added:

-   `tonumber` - converts a string value into a float.
-   `time_close` - returns the UNIX timestamp of the close of the
    current bar, based on the resolution and session that is passed to
    the function.
-   `dividends` - requests dividends data for the specified symbol.
-   `earnings` - requests earnings data for the specified symbol.
-   `splits` - requests splits data for the specified symbol.

New arguments for the study() function were added:

-   `resolution_gaps` - fills the gaps between values fetched from
    higher timeframes when using `resolution`.
-   `format.percent` - formats the script output values as a percentage.

## February 2021

New variable was added:

-   `time_tradingday` - the beginning time of the trading day the
    current bar belongs to.

    of lines and labels by setting values for these parameters from 1 to
    500.

New function was added:

-   `array.range` - return the difference between the min and max values

    close[0] > close[1] and close[1] > close[2] and close[2] > close[3]

## September 2020

Added support for `input.color` to the `input()` function. Now you can
provide script users with color selection through the script's
\"Settings/Inputs\" tab with the same color widget used throughout the
TradingView user interface. Learn more about this feature in our
[blog](https://www.tradingview.com/blog/en/create-color-inputs-in-pine-20751/):

    //@version=4
    study("My Script", overlay = true)
    color c_labelColor = input(color.green, "Main Color", input.color)
    var l = label.new(bar_index, close, yloc = yloc.abovebar, text = "Colored label")
    label.set_x(l, bar_index)
    label.set_color(l, c_labelColor)

![image](@assets/images/input_color.png)

Added support for arrays and functions for working with them. You can
now use the powerful new array feature to build custom datasets. See our
[User Manual page on
arrays](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v4/essential/Arrays.html)
and our
[blog](https://www.tradingview.com/blog/en/arrays-are-now-available-in-pine-script-20052/):

    //@version=4
    study("My Script")
    a = array.new_float(0)

![image](@assets/images/Mtf.png)

Please note that you need to reapply the indicator in order for the
[resolution] parameter to appear.

-   The `tooltip` argument was added to the `label.new` function along
    with the `label.set_tooltip` function:

        //@version=4
        study("My Script", overlay=true)
        var l=label.new(bar_index, close, yloc=yloc.abovebar, text="Label")
        label.set_x(l,bar_index)
        label.set_tooltip(l, "Label Tooltip")

![image](@assets/images/Tooltip.png)

-   Added an ability to create [alerts on
    strategies](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?solution=43000481368).
-   A new function
    [line.get_price](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_line%7Bdot%7Dget_price)
    can be used to determine the price level at which the line is
    located on a certain bar.
-   New [label
    styles](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_label%7Bdot%7Dnew)
    allow you to position the label pointer in any direction.

![image](@assets/images/new_label_styles.png)

-   Find and Replace was added to Pine Editor. To use this, press CTRL+F
    (find) or CTRL+H (find and replace).

![image](@assets/images/FindReplace.jpg)

-   `timezone` argument was added for time functions. Now you can
    specify timezone for `second`, `minute`, `hour`, `year`, `month`,
    `dayofmonth`, `dayofweek` functions:

        //@version=4
        study("My Script")
        plot(hour(1591012800000, "GMT+1"))

-   `syminfo.basecurrency` variable was added. Returns the base currency
    code of the current symbol. For EURUSD symbol returns EUR.

## May 2020

-   `else if` statement was added
-   The behavior of `security` function has changed: the `expression`
    parameter can be series or tuple.

## April 2020

New function was added:

-   `quandl` - request quandl data for a symbol

## March 2020

New function was added:

## February 2020

-   New Pine indicator VWAP Anchored was added. Now you can specify the
    time period: Session, Month, Week, Year.

-   Fixed a problem with calculating `percentrank` function. Now it can
    return a zero value, which did not happen before due to an incorrect
    calculation.

-   The default `transparency` parameter for the `plot`, `plotshape`,
    and `plotchar` functions is now 0%.

-   For the functions `plot`, `plotshape`, `plotchar`, `plotbar`,
    `plotcandle`, `plotarrow`, you can set the `display` parameter,
    which controls the display of the plot. The following values can be
    assigned to it:

    -   `display.none` - the plot is not displayed
    -   `display.all` - the plot is displayed (Default)

-   The `textalign` argument was added to the `label.new` function along
    with the `label.set_textalign` function. Using those, you can
    control the alignment of the label\'s text:

        //@version=4
        study("My Script", overlay = true)

        label.set_xy(l, bar_index, high)

    ![image](@assets/images/Label_text_align.png)

## January 2020

New built-in variables were added:

-   `iii` - Intraday Intensity Index

-   `obv` - On Balance Volume
-   `pvt` - Price-Volume Trend
-   `nvi` - Negative Volume Index
-   `pvi` - Positive Volume Index

New parameters were added for `strategy.close`:

-   `qty` - the number of contracts/shares/lots/units to exit a trade
    with
-   `qty_percent` - defines the percentage of entered
    contracts/shares/lots/units to exit a trade with
-   `comment` - addtional notes on the order

New parameter was added for `strategy.close_all`:

-   `comment` - additional notes on the order

## December 2019

-   Warning messages were added.

    For example, if you don\'t specify exit parameters for
    `strategy.exit` - `profit`, `limit`, `loss`, `stop` or one of the
    following pairs: `trail_offset` and `trail_price` / `trail_points` -
    you will see a warning message in the console in the Pine editor.

-   Increased the maximum number of arguments in `max`, `min`, `avg`
    functions. Now you can use up to ten arguments in these functions.

## October 2019

-   `plotchar` function now supports most of the Unicode symbols:

        //@version=4
        study("My Script", overlay=true)
        plotchar(open > close, char="🐻")

    ![image](@assets/images/Bears_in_plotchar.png)

-   New `bordercolor` argument of the `plotcandle` function allows you
    to change the color of candles\' borders:

        //@version=4
        study("My Script")
        plotcandle(open, high, low, close, title='Title', color = open < close ? color.green : color.red, wickcolor=color.black, bordercolor=color.orange)

-   New variables added:

    -   `syminfo.description` - returns a description of the current
        symbol
    -   `syminfo.currency` - returns the currency code of the current
        symbol (EUR, USD, etc.)
    -   `syminfo.type` - returns the type of the current symbol (stock,
        futures, index, etc.)

## September 2019

New parameters to the `strategy` function were added:

-   `process_orders_on_close` allows the broker emulator to try to
    execute orders after calculating the strategy at the bar\'s close
-   `close_entries_rule` allows to define the sequence used for closing
    positions

Some fixes were made:

-   `fill` function now works correctly with `na` as the `color`
    parameter value
-   `sign` function now calculates correctly for literals and constants

`str.replace_all (source, target, replacement)` function was added. It
replaces each occurrence of a `target` string in the `source` string
with a `replacement` string

## July-August 2019

New variables added:

-   `timeframe.isseconds` returns true when current resolution is in
    seconds
-   `timeframe.isminutes` returns true when current resolution is in
    minutes
-   `time_close` returns the current bar\'s close time

The behavior of some functions, variables and operators has changed:

-   The `time` variable returns the correct open time of the bar for
    more special cases than before

-   An optional *seconds* parameter of the `timestamp` function allows
    you to set the time to within seconds

-   `security` function:

    -   Added the possibility of requesting resolutions in seconds:

        1, 5, 15, 30 seconds (chart resolution should be less than or
        equal to the requested resolution)

    -   Reduced the maximum value that can be requested in some of the
        other resolutions:

        from 1 to 1440 minutes

        from 1 to 365 days

        from 1 to 52 weeks

        from 1 to 12 months

-   Changes to the evaluation of ternary operator branches:

    In Pine v3, during the execution of a ternary operator, both its
    branches are calculated, so when this script is added to the chart,
    a long position is opened, even if the long() function is not
    called:

        //@version=3
        strategy(title = "My Strategy")
        long() =>
            strategy.entry("long", true, 1, when = open > high[1])
            1
        c = 0
        c := true ? 1 : long()
        plot(c)

    Pine v4 contains built-in functions with side effects ( `line.new`
    and `label.new` ). If calls to these functions are present in both
    branches of a ternary operator, both function calls would be
    executed following v3 conventions. Thus, in Pine v4, only the branch
    corresponding to the evaluated condition is calculated. While this
    provides a viable solution in some cases, it will modify the
    behavior of scripts which depended on the fact that both branches of
    a ternary were evaluated. The solution is to pre-evaluate
    expressions prior to the ternary operator. The conversion utility
    takes this requirement into account when converting scripts from v3
    to v4, so that script behavior will be identical in v3 and v4.

## June 2019

-   Support for drawing objects. Added *label* and *line* drawings
-   `var` keyword for one time variable initialization
-   Type system improvements:
    -   *series string* data type
    -   functions for explicit type casting
    -   syntax for explicit variable type declaration
    -   new *input* type forms
-   Renaming of built-ins and a version 3 to 4 converter utility
-   `max_bars_back` function to control series variables internal
    history buffer sizes
-   Pine Script documentation versioning

## October 2018

-   To increase the number of indicators available to the whole
    community, Invite-Only scripts can now be published by Premium users
    only.

## April 2018

-   Improved the Strategy Tester by reworking the Maximum Drawdown
    calculation formula.

## August 2017

-   With the new argument `show_last` in the plot-type functions, you
    can restrict the number of bars that the plot is displayed on.

## June 2017

-   A major script publishing improvement: it is now possible to update
    your script without publishing a new one via the Update button in
    the publishing dialog.

## May 2017

-   Expanded the type system by adding a new type of constants that can
    be calculated during compilation.

## April 2017

-   Expanded the keyword argument functionality: it is now possible to
    use keyword arguments in all built-in functions.
-   A new `barstate.isconfirmed` variable has been added to the list of
    variables that return bar status. It lets you create indicators that
    are calculated based on the closed bars only.
-   The `options` argument for the `input()` function creates an input
    with a set of options defined by the script\'s author.

## March 2017

-   Pine Script v3 is here! Some important changes:
    -   Changes to the default behavior of the `security()` function: it
        can no longer access the future data by default. This can be
        changes with the `lookahead` parameter.
    -   An implicit conversion of boolean values to numeric values was
        replaced with an implicit conversion of numeric values (integer
        and float) to boolean values.
    -   Self-referenced and forward-referenced variables were removed.
        Any PineScript code that used those language constructions can
        be equivalently rewritten using mutable variables.

## February 2017

-   Several improvements to the strategy tester and the strategy report:
    -   New Buy & Hold equity graph -- a new graph that lets you compare
        performance of your strategy versus a \"buy and hold\", i.e if
        you just bought a security and held onto it without trading.
    -   Added percentage values to the absolute currency values.
    -   Added Buy & Hold Return to display the final value of Buy & Hold
        Equity based on last price.
    -   Added Sharpe Ratio -- it shows the relative effectiveness of the
        investment portfolio (security), a measure that indicates the
        average return minus the risk-free return divided by the
        standard deviation of return on an investment.
    -   Slippage lets you simulate a situation when orders are filled at
        a worse price than expected. It can be set through the
        Properties dialog or through the slippage argument in the
        `strategy()` function.
    -   Commission allows yot to add commission for placed orders in
        percent of order value, fixed price or per contract. The amount
        of commission paid is shown in the Commission Paid field. The
        commission size and its type can be set through the Properties
        dialog or through the commission_type and commission_value
        arguments in the `strategy()` function.

## December 2016

-   Added invite-only scripts. The invite-only indicators are visible in
    the Public Library, but nobody can use them without explicit
    permission from the author, and only the author can see the source
    code.

## October 2016

-   Introduded indicator revisions. Each time an indicator is saved, it
    gets a new revision, and it is possible to easily switch to any past
    revision from the Pine Editor.

## September 2016

-   It is now possible to publish indicators with protected source code.
    These indicators are available in the public Script Library, and any
    user can use them, but only the author can see the source code.

## July 2016

-   Improved the behavior of the `fill()` function: one call can now
    support several different colors.

## March 2016

-   Color type variables now have an additional parameter to set default
    transparency. The transparency can be set with the `color.new()`
    function, or by adding an alpha-channel value to a hex color code.

## February 2016

-   Added `for` loops and keywords `break` and `continue`.
-   Pine now supports mutable variables! Use the `:=` operator to assign
    a new value to a variable that has already been defined.
-   Multiple improvements and bug fixes for strategies.

## January 2016

-   A new `alertcondition()` function allows for creating custom alert
    conditions in Pine-based indicators.

## October 2015

-   Pine has graduated to v2! The new version of Pine Script added
    support for `if` statements, making it easier to write more readable
    and concise code.

## September 2015

-   Added backtesting functionality to Pine. It is now possible to
    create trading strategies, i.e. scripts that can send, modify and
    cancel orders to buy or sell. Strategies allow you to perform
    backtesting (emulation of strategy trading on historical data) and
    forward testing (emulation of strategy trading on real-time data)
    according to your algorithms. Detailed information about the
    strategy\'s calculations and the order fills can be seen in the
    newly added Strategy Tester tab.

## July 2015

-   A new `editable` parameter allows hiding the plot from the Style
    menu in the indicator settings so that it is not possible to edit
    its style. The parameter has been added to all the following
    functions: all plot-type functions, `barcolor()`, `bgcolor()`,
    `hline()`, and `fill()`.

## June 2015

-   Added two new functions to display custom barsets using PineScipt:
    `plotbar()` and `plotcandle()`.

## April 2015

-   Added two new shapes to the `plotshape()` function: shape.labelup
    and shape.labeldown.
-   PineScipt Editor has been improved and moved to a new panel at the
    bottom of the page.
-   Added a new `step` argument for the `input()` function, allowing to
    specify the step size for the indicator\'s inputs.

## March 2015

-   Added support for inputs with the `source` type to the `input()`
    function, allowing to select the data source for the indicator\'s
    calculations from its settings.

## February 2015

-   Added a new `text` argument to `plotshape()` and `plotchar()`
    functions.
-   Added four new shapes to the `plotshape()` function: shape.arrowup,
    shape.arrowdown, shape.square, shape.diamond.

## August 2014

-   Improved the script sharing capabilities, changed the layout of the
    Indicators menu and separated published scripts from ideas.

## July 2014

-   Added three new plotting functions, `plotshape()`, `plotchar()`, and
    `plotarrow()` for situations when you need to highlight specific
    bars on a chart without drawing a line.
-   Integrated QUANDL data into Pine Script. The data can be accessed by
    passing the QUANDL ticker to the `security` function.

## June 2014

-   Added Pine Script sharing, enabling coders and traders to share
    their scripts with the rest of the TradingView community.

## April 2014

-   Added line wrapping.

## February 2014

-   Added support for inputs, allowing users to edit the indicator
    inputs through the properties window, without needing to edit the
    Pine script.
-   Added self-referencing variables.
-   Added support for multiline functions.
-   Implemented the type-casting mechanism, automatically casting
    constant and simple float and int values to series when it is
    required.
-   Added several new functions and improved the existing ones:
    -   `barssince()` and `valuewhen()` allow you to check conditions on
        historical data easier.
    -   The new `barcolor()` function lets you specify a color for a bar
        based on filling of a certain condition.
    -   Similar to the `barcolor()` function, the `bgcolor()` function
        changes the color of the background.
    -   Reworked the `security()` function, further expanding its
        functionality.
    -   Improved the `fill()` function, enabling it to be used more than
        once in one script.
    -   Added the `round()` function to round and convert float values
        to integers.

## December 2013

-   The first version of Pine is introduced to all TradingView users,
    initially as an open beta, on December 13th.
