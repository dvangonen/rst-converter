# Welcome to Pine Script™

![Pine Script™ logo](@assets/images/logo/Pine_Script_logo_text.png)


It\'s our explicit goal to keep Pine Script™ accessible and easy to
understand for the broadest possible audience. Pine Script™ is
cloud-based and therefore different from client-side programming
languages. While we likely won\'t develop Pine Script™ into a
full-fledged language, we do constantly improve it and are always happy
to consider requests for new features.

Because each script uses computational resources in the cloud, we must
impose limits in order to share these resources fairly among our users.
We strive to set as few limits as possible, but will of course have to
implement as many as needed for the platform to run smoothly.
Limitations apply to the amount of data requested from additional
symbols, execution time, memory usage and script size.
