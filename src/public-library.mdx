# Public Library 


## Description

On TradingView you may choose from our built-in scripts, from the
user-published scripts in the *Public Library*, or write your own custom
scripts using Pine Scriptâ„¢. You can search the library for scripts
before writing one. You may also ask users who publish scripts for help
by sending them a private message (PM) on TradingView.

The Public Library contains all user-published scripts. All published
scripts can be viewed either from the
[Scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/script/) section of
tradingview.com\'s page, or from the *Indicators* *Public Library* tab:

## Copying a script from the Public to your Personal Library

To copy a script, use one of the two following methods:

1.  Click the star next to the needed script in the Indicators window:

![Add_to_Personal_Library](@assets/images/PublicLibrary-Add_to_Personal_Library.png)

2.  Open the needed script from the
    [Scripts](https://www.tradingview.com/script/) section and click the
    *Add to Favorite Scripts* button:

![Add_to_Personal_Library_2](@assets/images/PublicLibrary-Add_to_Personal_Library_2.png)

The script will be added to your Favorites section in the Indicators
window, where you can easily find it when needed:

![Favorites_section](@assets/images/PublicLibrary-Favorites_section.png)

Scripts in the *Indicators* window are sorted by popularity. Scripts
with the most likes appear first:

## Editing a script from the Public Library

To edit a script from the Public Library:

1.  Open the script (the script will be unavailable for editing and will
    be colored lighter than normal):

![Open_the_script](@assets/images/PublicLibrary-Open_the_script.png)

2.  Click on the *Make a Copy\...* button, enter the desired name and
    save a copy in your personal library:

![Save_as](@assets/images/PublicLibrary-Save_as.png)

A saved copy of the script will appear in the list of your scripts in
the *Indicators* *My Scripts* tab:

![My_Scripts](@assets/images/PublicLibrary-My_Scripts.png)

Now you can open and edit the script.

If the same script is published more than once, a notification on older
versions will appear, indicating a new version is available.

## Searching for a script

To search for a script, use the *Search* field in the *Indicators*
dialog:

![Search](@assets/images/PublicLibrary-Search.png)

This will search both your Personal and Public Library at the same time.

You may also search for scripts from the tradingview.com home page by
first selecting *Scripts* from the *Ticker* dropdown menu and entering
your search criteria.
